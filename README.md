# Seattle-WA-Housing-Market

For this project I looked at housing prices and multiple variables to see if these variables would affect the price of the homes. Some of the variables were square foot of living space, zip code, how many floors, bathrooms, bedrooms, grade of design and construction, view the house has, condition of house, waterfront property, and more.

I hypothesized that the houses with the better grade, condition, view, the number of bathroom and bedrooms would have the most affect on the price of the houses. 

Once data was analysis, I saw that the variable with the largest correlation was square foot of living space. The others did not have that great of an impact.
